### Proposed list of 'seed' topics for the Issues page before the site goes public,

1. Suitability of Licence

- Choice of metalanguage (SAIL, Haskell, Coq)

- Dependencies on tools

- Tool ecosystem: other work being done/enabled with those tools

- How well does it meets expectations for a formal spec?

- Current functional coverage (Base ISA, Extensions, Privilige Levels)

- Current specification of assembly syntax and encoding

- Current treatment of concurrency

- Current treatment of floating-point

- Current capabilities as a simulator/emulator

- Current capabilities as test oracle in tandem verification

- Current capabilities: theorem-prover definitions that support proof

- Current capabilities as documentation (as a replacement and/or
    complement to "User-Level ISA Instruction Set Manual" and
    "Privileged Architecture Instruction Set Manual")

- Current capabilities for use in test generation

- Current capabilities of concurrency-model for Weak Memory Model litmus testing

- Current test coverage: ISA tests

- Current test coverage: Compliance Test Suite

- Current test coverage: OS booting

- Current test coverage: Weak Memory Model litmus test testing

- Current test coverage: other tests

- Plans for future functional coverage

- Plans for long-term access, maintenance, etc.

- Quality of "Reading Guide" (for those who just want to read it like
    an ISA manual).  Example audiences: assembly language programmers,
    compiler writers, software verification engineers, CPU hardware
    designers, hardware verification engineers, Compliance testers
    and, of course, people interested in using it for formal analysis
    and manipulation.  Accessibility to those who are not familiar
    with the metalanguage (SAIL, Haskell, Coq)?

- Quality of "How to Compile/Run Guide" (for those who want to execute a model on programs: ISA tests, Compliance tests, other programs).  (a) Ease of building a the spec as a simulator?  (b) Ease of compiling and running a program on the simulator?

- Quality of "How to Extend Guide" (for those who want to extend the model to capture new ISA extensions/experiments)
